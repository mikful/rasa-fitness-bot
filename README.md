# rasa-fitness-bot

## Install

See requirements.txt for conda env installation instructions.

## Usage

`conda activate "your_env_name"`

In one terminal run the rasa actions server: `rasa run actions`

In a separate terminal run the rasa shell: `rasa shell`

You can now interact with the bot. e.g typing "how can I get fit?" should return the google search results.
